# Software-Enabled Flash™ Technology

##### A new way to maximize the potential of flash.

### KIOXIA's Software-Enabled Flash™ (SEF) Technology

Hyperscalers are looking to evolve and redefine the use of flash in their data centers. What is needed to accelerate this trend are tools that leverage the native speed and flexibility of flash, coupled with the ease of software-defined storage.

KIOXIAS's Software-Enabled Flash™ (SEF) technology supports this emerging paradigm by fundamentally redefining the relationship between the host and solid-state storage. SEF technology consists of purpose-built, media-centric flash hardware focused on hyperscaler requirements, with an open source API and libraries to provide the functionality hyperscalers demand.

**Simply put: SEF technology brings software flexibility and scalability to flash.**
