### KIOXIA Software-Enabled Flash Technology

Hyperscalers are looking to evolve and redefine the use of flash in their data centers. To accelerate this trend, tools are needed that leverage the native speed and flexibility of flash, coupled with the ease of software-defined storage.

KIOXIA Software-Enabled Flash technology supports this emerging paradigm by fundamentally redefining the relationship between the host and solid-state storage. The technology consists of purpose-built, media-centric flash hardware focused on hyperscaler requirements, with an open source API and libraries to provide the functionality hyperscalers demand.

**Simply put: Software-Enabled Flash technology brings software flexibility and scalability to flash.**
